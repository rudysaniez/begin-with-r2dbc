## Presentation

Reactive APIs are very powerful to handle and serve large amounts of data and large number of requests in a web application.

The stream reactive model is equivalent to the `Publisher-Subscriber` pattern. So, the client subscribes to `events` on the server which pushes the data through several operators which contains a data stream.

It can't be useful in CRUD application. However, it offers improved performance versus the standard `request-response` paradigm. In addition, the implementation is very easy with Spring-Boot which integration the feature named `spring-boot-starter-webflux`. Spring WebFlux is very powerful and uses the Reactor Project.

A other thing, in the SQL World, without R2dbc, the Reactive programming paradigm is useless. Indeed, the JDBC driver is blocking by default. Now, with R2dbc, it possible to use H2/Postgres/MySQL in the Reactive World.
